# Required Software:
1. Python3
  - On Windows I recommend installing it through chocolatey, check out https://chocolatey.org/install
  - After installing chocolatey, run this command on the terminal: choco install python3 --pre 
2. Install the following libraries: BeautifulSoup and urllib3
  - pip install beautifulsoup4
  - pip install urllib3

# How to use:

1. Find the HLTV match page link
2. At the top of the file there's a "link = ...." variable
3. Change the existing example link for the one you want
4. Save the file to hltv.py
5. (Windows) Using the terminal, navigate to the folder where you have the file at, and run "python ./hltv.py"
